# WeRateDogsTwitterAnalysis
### Overview

The goal of this project is majorly focused on gathering data from different sources and in various 
formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. Extra data from twitter like retweets and favorite counts of 
each tweet will be gathered through querying Twitter APIs with tweet IDs available in the dataset provided. We will then store, analyze and visualize the wrangled data to get 
useful insights from it. The dataset that we will be using for this project is the tweet archive of 
Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs which is a Twitter account that rates 
people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.
